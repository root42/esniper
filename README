NOTE: This is an Beta release.  Major changes to esniper have been made
to accommodate eBay's switch to SSL login.  Bugs are to be expected.

A MS Visual C++ workspace (esniper.dsw), project (esniper.dsp) and
makefile (esniper.mak) are not up-to-date.  In particular, they have
not been modified to use libcurl.
