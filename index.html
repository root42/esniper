<p>
esniper is a simple, lightweight tool for sniping ebay auctions.  It runs
on all flavors of linux, unix and Windows, and should adapt easily to
other operating systems.
<p>
You can download the
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/esniper/esniper-2-14-0.tgz?download">
source code</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=45285&atid=442436">
report bugs</a>,
and a bunch of other things from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/esniper/">sourceforge.net</a>.
<p>
To be informed of new releases and major bugs,
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/esniper-announce">subscribe</a>
to the esniper-announce mailing list.
<p>
To compile and run esniper you need
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">SSL</a> and
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libCurl</a>.
Most recent linux releases should have these libraries already installed.
If your system doesn't have these libraries or they are out of date, you
will need to download, build and install these libraries first.  You must
build and install SSL before building and installing libCurl.
<p>
If you are using Windows, you will need to use either
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> or
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW and MSYS</a>
for a development environment, and SSL and libCurl.  I hope to have a
prebuilt Windows binary available in the near future.
<p>
If you need documentation, you can read the
<a href="esniper_man.html">manual page</a>, or download a
<a href="esniper.1">
unix man compatible version</a>
and place it in /usr/local/man/man1 on your computer.
<p>
esniper can use configuration and auction files to tell it how to bid and what
to bid on.  Sample files
(<a href="sample_config.txt">configuration</a>,
<a href="sample_auction.txt">auction</a>) are available.

FAQ:
<ul>
<li><b>What is sniping?</b>
<ul><li>Sniping is the act of bidding on an auction with
just a few seconds remaining.
</ul>
<li><b>Why snipe?</b>
<ul><li>Because it is better than bidding early.  For more information on
sniping, including reasons for and against, click
<a href="http://www.moyen.org/snipe/">here</a>.
</ul>
<li><b>What's wrong with bidding early?</b>
<ul>
<li>In a perfect world, nothing.  The world isn't perfect, though.  Most
eBay bids are
<a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/buyerguide/bidding-prxy.html">
proxy bids</a>.  If everybody understood that, figured out how much they
wanted to pay, and bid their maximum, sniping would not be useful.
However, many bidders have no idea how much they want to pay, so they bid
in small increments until they beat your proxy.  If you bid your maximum
at the end of the auction, you greatly reduce the chances of being bid
up by such a bidder.
</ul>
<li><b>Is sniping against eBay policy</b>
<ul><li>No.  You may bid at any time in an eBay auction.</ul>
<li><b>I think sniping is evil</b>
<ul><li>You are entitled to your opinion, but you may want to check out
<a href="http://www.moyen.org/snipe/">
this very comprehensive site</a>
first so you can make an informed decision.</ul>
<li><b>Is using a program to snipe against eBay policy</b>
<ul><li>
This is a difficult question to answer.  In paragraph 7 of eBay's
<a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/png-user.html">
user agreement</a>, &quot;you will not user any ... automatic device, or
manual process to monitor or copy our web pages&quot;.  From this, it
appears just reloading an auction page a few times could be illegal (manual
monitoring).  Auction services which automatically retrieve closing prices,
such as Andale and PayPal, seem to go against this clause, too.
</ul>
<li><b>esniper is complaining about a CAPTCHA.  What's that?</b>
<ul><li>It's a security measure to prevent 'bots (like esniper)
from working.  See
<a href="captcha.html">here</a>
for more details.
