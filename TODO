Proxy support
- authentication, proxy connection keep-alive

Languages (German, French, ...)
- output only.  Handling input in multiple languages (i.e. reading from
  ebay.de, ebay.ca, etc) is too much work.  You would need to either add
  an auction.c for each site supported, or create a meta-language describing
  how to parse each page.  Plus eBay likes to change their output without
  notice!
