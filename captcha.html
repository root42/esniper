<p>
A <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a> is a test that
is easy for a human to solve, but difficult for a computer.  CAPTCHAs are
used to foil automated tools, like esniper.
<p>
In 2006 eBay started to selectively use CAPTCHAs for login.  The use of
CAPTCHAs appears to be triggered by suspicious activity, such as:
<ul>
<li>Too many failed login attempts</li>
<li>Logging in from a different IP addresses than usual</li>
<li>Using proxies</li>
<li>Logging in near-simultaneously from two different IP addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>
There's no definitive way to know exactly what eBay considers suspicious.
However, if you are being asked to respond to a CAPTCHA, you can be pretty
sure it's something you've done.
<p>
esniper cannot respond to CAPTCHAs.  To fix this problem:
<ol>
<li>Stop using esniper (temporarily)</li>
<li>Log in to eBay using a web browser and answer the CAPTCHA</li>
<li>Continue to use a browser to access ebay for the next few days, until eBay stops presenting CAPTCHAs to you</li>
<li>Start using esniper again</li>
</ol>
<p>
Try to think about what you might have done to attract eBay's suspicions, and
try not to do that in the future.
<p>
For example, near-simultaneous logins from
different IP addresses can happen if you have esniper running at home, and
you are checking eBay while at work.  A solution is to have two eBay accounts,
one for each IP address.
