<h1>esniper</h1>

<p>
esniper is a simple, lightweight tool for sniping ebay auctions. It runs on
all flavors of linux, unix and Windows, and should adapt easily to other
operating systems. 
</p>

<p>
You can download the 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/esniper/esniper-2-21-0.tgz?download">source
code</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=45285&amp;atid=442436">report
bugs</a>,
and a bunch of other things from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/esniper/">sourceforge.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
To be informed of new releases and major bugs, 
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/esniper-announce">subscribe</a>
to the esniper-announce mailing list. 
</p>

<p>
To compile and run esniper you need 
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">SSL</a> and 
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libCurl</a>.
Most recent linux releases
should have these libraries already installed. If your system doesn't have
these libraries or they are out of date, you will need to download, build and
install these libraries first. You must build and install SSL before building
and installing libCurl. 
</p>

<p>
If you are using Windows, you will need to use either 
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> or 
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW and MSYS</a> 
for a development environment,
and SSL and libCurl. I hope to have a prebuilt Windows binary available in the
future. 
</p>

<p>
If you need documentation, you can read the 
<a href="esniper_man.html">manual page</a>, or download a 
<a href="esniper.1">unix man compatible version</a> 
and place it in /usr/local/man/man1 on your
computer. 
</p>

<p>
esniper can use configuration and auction files to tell it how to bid and
what to bid on. Sample files (<a href="sample_config.txt">configuration</a>, 
<a href="sample_auction.txt">auction</a>) are available.

<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span class="question">What is sniping?</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">Sniping is the act of bidding on an auction with just a few seconds
        remaining. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">Why snipe?</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">Because it is better than bidding early. For more information on
        sniping, including reasons for and against, click <a
        href="http://www.moyen.org/snipe/">here</a>. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">What's wrong with bidding early?</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">In a perfect world, nothing. The world isn't perfect, though. Most
        eBay bids are <a
        href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/buyerguide/bidding-prxy.html">proxy
        bids</a>. If everybody understood that, figured out how much they
        wanted to pay, and bid their maximum, sniping would not be useful.
        However, many bidders have no idea how much they want to pay, so they
        bid in small increments until they beat your proxy. If you bid your
        maximum at the end of the auction, you greatly reduce the chances of
        being bid up by such a bidder. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">Is sniping against eBay policy</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">No. You may bid at any time in an eBay auction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">I think sniping is evil</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">You are entitled to your opinion, but you may want to check out <a
        href="http://www.moyen.org/snipe/">this very comprehensive site</a>
        first so you can make an informed decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">Is using a program to snipe against eBay policy</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">This is a difficult question to answer. In paragraph 7 of eBay's <a
        href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/png-user.html">user
        agreement</a>, "you will not user any ... automatic device, or manual
        process to monitor or copy our web pages". From this, it appears just
        reloading an auction page a few times could be illegal (manual
        monitoring). Auction services which automatically retrieve closing
        prices, such as Andale and PayPal, seem to go against this clause, too.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">When I try to run esniper, it complains it can't find cygwin1.dll</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">Did you download <a
        href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/esniper/cygwin1.dll">cygwin1.dll</a>
        and place it in the same directory as esniper.exe? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">What is cygwin1.dll, anyway?</span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">It is part of <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a>, a package
        that emulates unix on top of Windows.
     </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="question">esniper is complaining about a CAPTCHA. What's
    that?</span>
    <ul>
      <li class="answer">It's a security measure to prevent 'bots (like esniper) from working.
        See <a href="captcha.html">here</a> for more details. <br>
        When eBay asks to solve a captcha this might be related to a weak eBay
        password. Try to change your password.
