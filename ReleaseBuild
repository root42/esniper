How to build a release:

From checked-out source directory...

If you have not already done so, add information about recent changes to 
ChangeLog and commit. (This file should contain the complete history.) 
	vi ChangeLog
	cvs commit

ReleaseNote and README will be created automatically from ChangeLog by
copying all text until the first empty line before the next 
"* x.y.z released" line. That means the ChangeLog file must have the correct
format.

Next, run ReleaseBuild.sh.  You will need to give 3 arguments, which are
the major, minor and step versions of this release.  For example, if you want
to create version 2.15.6:
	ReleaseBuild.sh 2 15 6

Depending on how you have your access to CVS setup, you might need to enter
your password half a dozen times, as cvs is called a lot in this script.

Next, go to sourceforge, login as a project admin, choose the files page.
Use the "Add Folder" button to add a directory (folder) for this release,
then upload the tar file.  Edit the file details.  Make the tar file the
default for all systems. 

Upload the README file to the top level directory. Its contents will be
displayed in all child directories.

Copy other files to sourceforge:

	scp sample* esniper.1 esniper_man.html version.txt index.html \
		esniper,esniper@web.sf.net:htdocs

Send email to esniper-announce@lists.sourceforge.net to announce the new 
version. This list is moderated, so you might have to accept the message
using the mailing list's administrator interface.

And you're done!
