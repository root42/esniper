How to build a release:

From checked-out source directory...

First, copy ChangeLog to ReleaseNote, then edit ReleaseNote to remove all
notes from previous releases.
	cp ChangeLog ReleaseNote
	vi ReleaseNote

Next, run ReleaseBuild.sh.  You will need to give 3 arguemnts, which are
the major, minor and step versions of this release.  For example, if you want
to create version 2.15.6:
	ReleaseBuild.sh 2 15 6

Depending on hwo you have your access to CVS setup, you might need to enter
your password half a dozen times, as cvs is called a lot in this script.

Next, go to sourceforge, project admin, file manager.  Add a directory (folder)
for this release, then upload the tar file and ReleaseNote.  Edit the file
details.  Make the tar file the default for all systems.  Make ReleaseNote a release note.  Edit the folder details and associate ReleaseNote with this folder.

Copy other files to sourceforge:

	scp sample* esniper.1 esniper_man.html version.txt index.html \
		esniper,esniper@web.sf.net:htdocs

Send email to esniper-announce@lists.sourceforge.net to announce the
new version.

And you're done...
