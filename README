NOTE: This is an Alpha release.  Major changes to esniper have been made
to accommodate eBay's switch to SSL login.  Bugs are to be expected.

This project is so simple, I didn't even bother to use autoconf.  For most
systems, just type "make", then "make install" (perhaps as root).  If you
have a problem, you might want to uncomment the LIBS line in the Makefile
and try again.

A MS Visual C++ workspace (esniper.dsw), project (esniper.dsp) and
makefile (esniper.mak) are available for building the native Windows
version.  NOTE: the Windows build files have not been modified to
use libcurl.
