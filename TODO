Proxy support
- squid, etc

Languages (German, French, ...)
- output only.  Handling input in multiple languages (i.e. reading from
  ebay.de, ebay.ca, etc) is too much work.  You would need to either add
  an auction.c for each site supported, or create a meta-language describing
  how to parse each page.  Plus eBay likes to change their output without
  notice!

Native port to Windows
- a little tricky, because esniper uses sockets as if they were files.  Unix
  supports this, Windows doesn't.  Would require, at the least, rewrite of
  auction.c.
