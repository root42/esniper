# A config file contains variable settings, blank lines, and comments (begin
# with #).  The default configuration file is $HOME/.esniper, and if you
# specify an auction file, .esniper in the auction file's directory as well.
# If you specify a configuration file using the -c command-line option, then
# that configuration file will be the only one read.
#
# If you set your password in a config file and you are on a unix system,
# you should be the owner of the file, and you should set the permissions
# so that it is readable only by the owner.
#
# Here are all the variables.  Note that if the default (as defined in
# esniper -H) is fine, you don't need to specify it in a config file

# boolean parameters can be set to:
#	true, y, yes, on, 1, enabled
#	false, n, no, off, 0, disabled
batch = false
bid = yes
debug = enabled
reduce = y

# Note: it would be nice if logdir could use ~myuser, or $HOME.  Perhaps in
# a future version.
logdir = /export/home/myuser/esniperlogs
password = myebaypassword
# Note: proxy authentication not yet supported
proxy = http://192.168.1.1:8080/
username = myebayusername

# Note: quantity is usually set in an auction file
quantity = 1
# Note: seconds can also be "now", if you want to bid immediately
seconds = 10
