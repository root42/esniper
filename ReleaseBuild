How to build a release:

From checked-out source directory...

First, copy ChangeLog to ReleaseNote, then edit ReleaseNote to remove all
notes from previous releases.
	cp ChangeLog ReleaseNote
	vi ReleaseNote

Rename or copy ReleaseNote to README as sourceforge now wants to have
a README file instead of ReleaseNote.

Next, run ReleaseBuild.sh.  You will need to give 3 arguments, which are
the major, minor and step versions of this release.  For example, if you want
to create version 2.15.6:
	ReleaseBuild.sh 2 15 6

Depending on how you have your access to CVS setup, you might need to enter
your password half a dozen times, as cvs is called a lot in this script.

Next, go to sourceforge, login as a project admin, choose the files page.
Use the "Add Folder" button to add a directory (folder) for this release,
then upload the tar file.  Edit the file details.  Make the tar file the
default for all systems. 

Upload the README file to the top level directory. Its contents will be
displayed in all child directories.

Copy other files to sourceforge:

	scp sample* esniper.1 esniper_man.html version.txt index.html \
		esniper,esniper@web.sf.net:htdocs

Send email to esniper-announce@lists.sourceforge.net to announce the
new version.

And you're done!
